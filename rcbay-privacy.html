  As described below, as part of the normal operation of our services, your information is collected by us, and disclosed
  to third parties including your future buyers. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you and
  what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we
  believe you should know as much as possible about rcbay's practices so that you can make informed decisions.

  By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions during registration, you expressly consent to our use and

  <li>
    <h2>Our Use of Your Information.</h2>

    <p>
      We use your information to facilitate the services you request. We use information in the file we maintain about
      you and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve disputes,
      troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify
      problems or resolve disputes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you choose to use our service when you list an item for sale on eBay, we use and capture the transaction
      information regarding that particular sale at that particular site. Such transaction information includes, but is
      not limited to, the buyerâ€™s id, buyer's email and physical address, the final price paid during the transaction,
      the method of transaction (such as fixed price or auction), the date and time of the transaction, the title of the
      purchase, the category of the purchase and the shipping address of the buyer and any other information relevant to
      the establishment or use of your rcbay service.

    <p>
      You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are
      targeted to your interests, such as administrative notices, update emails, product offerings, and communications
      relevant to your use of the site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive
      this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, please do not use our service. Once you cancel
      our service, we will delete your information no later than 12 months after cancellation.

    <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information.</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally
      identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example
      (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under
      certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
      Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should
      not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with
      our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services,
      throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least
      as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures
      follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent
      allowed by applicable law. It is possible that rcbay, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination
      of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should
      expect that rcbay would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Information Collectors.</h2>

    <p>
      Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure
      of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether
      they are market venues, buyers or others on our site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may
      apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party
      advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since rcbay does not control the privacy policies of
      third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before
      you disclose your personal information to others.
    </p>

    <h2>Security.</h2>

    <p>
      rcbay uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information.
      rcbay treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We rely on our server
      providers to provide different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access
      by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
    </p>

    <h2>Notice</h2>

    <p>
      We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our site. All amended terms shall
      automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on our site. In addition, we will notify you in
      accordance with your Notification Preferences.
